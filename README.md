                                                       🛣️ Roadathon Project – Smart Emergency Response System

  The Roadathon Project is a web-based Emergency Response System designed to enhance coordination and communication among emergency service units—such as ambulances, police, and public users—during road accidents or emergencies. It leverages real-time maps, alert notifications, and role-based access (driver, police, public) to enable quicker and more efficient responses, potentially saving lives.
This platform was developed during a hackathon challenge to solve real-world transportation and safety problems using technology.
