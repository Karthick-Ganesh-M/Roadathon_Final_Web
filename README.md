                                                       🛣️ Roadathon Project – Smart Emergency Response System

  
The Roadathon Project is a web-based Emergency Response System developed to improve coordination and communication among emergency service units—including ambulances, police, and public users—in the event of road accidents or emergencies. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the platform provides an intuitive user interface and dynamic client-side interactions that support smooth navigation across different user roles. It incorporates the Google Maps API to render real-time location data, display incident zones, and assist in the geolocation of nearby responders. For secure user authentication, real-time data updates, and centralized storage, Firebase is integrated as the backend solution, ensuring data consistency across different user roles such as drivers, police officials, and the public. The application was collaboratively developed and version-controlled via GitHub, where it was also hosted and tested during a hackathon challenge aimed at addressing real-world transportation and emergency response issues. This project demonstrates how technology-driven coordination can significantly reduce response time and potentially save lives during critical events.
